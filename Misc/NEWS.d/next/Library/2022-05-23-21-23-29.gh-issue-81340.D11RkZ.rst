Use :func:`os.copy_file_range` in :func:`shutil.copy`, :func:`shutil.copy2`,
and :func:`shutil.copyfile` functions by default. An underlying Linux system
call gives filesystems an opportunity to implement the use of copy-on-write
(in case of btrfs and XFS) or server-side copy (in the case of NFS.) The
functions have a new *allow_reflink* argument to control the functionality.
